# C# samples

- Cubee.cs - Contains a couple of common functions I've developed for my MonoGame projects, particularly font printing with some custom formatting and DEBUG-build-only console output. This version has a couple of Ninja Cat-specific adjustments, like using the PICO-8 palette for the colour codes, as well as a little spaghetti.
- DynamicContentLoading.cs - A set of functions for my Everlost Isle MonoGame project that allows it to read in arbitrary "mod" assets into dictionaries or lists at runtime, using the mod's prefix to distinguish between items from different mods.
- WindowScaling.cs - Display-scaling functions from Everlost Isle and Ninja Cat Remewstered for fitting the internal display to the window. Both perform similar tasks with different goals.
